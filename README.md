## Sumary

This project uses the Wordpress CMS to store images which are then fetched with GraphQL.
The local CMS was set up using MAMP.

The GraphQL endpoint can be found at the top of the App.js file.

## Access

The local and live CMS can be accessed with the username and password provided in the instructions.
As requested, the caption is in the GraphQL response but is not displayed on the page.

## What I learned

Before starting this project, I was unfamiliar with `gsap` and its animations. It took some
time to understand how to make the animations work, but now that I have had some experience,
I look forward to using `gsap` in the future.

The component `Example.js` is a file I created in order to experiment with `gsap`.
`ImageSlider.js` is the requested component.
